# Pebble Navigation
This app will use your direction shared url from Goole Maps, parser it to get departure & destination location. Then, get the routes and show navigation when you come to the turn point.

It's just a demo version, tested on real, worked pretty good but lack of trusted (missing information about current route & the next route).
